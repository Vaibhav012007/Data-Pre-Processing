# Data-Pre-Processing

## Overview
This project preprocesses an air quality dataset with hourly sensor readings recorded over one year. The goal is to clean and prepare the data for analysis and predictive modeling.

## Steps Followed:

1. Handling Missing Values: Replace with median or interpolate time-series data.

2. Feature Scaling & Encoding: Standardization for normal distributions, Min-Max Scaling for skewed data.

3. Time-Based Feature Engineering: Extract hour, day, and month to capture periodic trends.

4. Outlier Detection & Handling: Use IQR/Z-score; apply Winsorization or percentile capping.

5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Summary statistics, histograms, boxplots, and time-series visualizations.
